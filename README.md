# WellScan
WellScan is an application that focuses on health and wellness by scanning food and cosmetic products to analyze their impact on your health. 

## Functionality
WellScan uses a barcode scanner to identify products. Once scanned, it provides a rating (out of 100) based on an analysis of the ingredients and potential health effects. It also offers a color code (green, yellow, orange, or red) for quick reference: green indicating a good choice and red indicating a product to avoid. 

## Data and Analysis
Various factors will be considered when alayzing products, including nutritional value (for food), presence of additives and artificial ingredients, and whether the product is organic. 

## Alternatives Recommendation
WellScan may suggest healthier alternatives for scanned products while providing detailed information about the ingredients
